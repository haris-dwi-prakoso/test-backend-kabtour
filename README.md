## Description

Transaction service made for Kabtour's Backend Developer Test.

## Design
The service is designed as a simple CRUD API that handles only the functions relevant to transactions. This service only stores the transaction database as any other databases would be outside the scope of the microservice model.

## Assumptions
Products are retrieved from the fake API provided in the test's description.\
As no other update operations were specified, the update function only updates the transaction status and reject reason when provided.

## Project setup

```bash
$ npm install
```
Ensure that you have a PostgreSQL database prepared for this project.\
Create a `.env` file in the project directory and define the following properties:
```
DB_HOST=(your database's hostname)
DB_PORT=(your database's port)
DB_USER=(username for logging into your database)
DB_PASS=(password for logging into your database)
DB_NAME=(the name of the database you intend to use for this project)
PORT=(optional, the port you wish to assign this application to)
```
An example has been provided in `.env.example`.

## Compile and run the project

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

## Run tests

```bash
# unit tests
$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```
Below is a list of paths currently registered within this application:
### /transaction
```
GET / get list of all transactions
POST / create new transaction
body: {
  buyerId: number, // ID of the user performing the purchase
  ownerId: number, // ID of the owner
  orders: [{
    itemId: number, // ID of the product being purchased
    amount: number // Amount of the product being purchased
  }]
}
GET /:id get the transaction registered under the specified id
PATCH /:id update the transaction registered under the specified id
body: {
  status: enum('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected'), // transaction status to be updated to
  rejectReason: string // transaction rejection reason if applicable
}
```
